  **Extending ElmJr with Metal**\
  Project Proposal - Capstone 2020

# Introduction

ElmJr [@zhang2018graphics] is a graphics creation application, used by
the McMaster Outreach program as part of a variety of tools used to
teach grade school students computer science. The application is a
projectional edtior for the Elm language, which allows users to create
basic shapes and geometry in 2D without running into syntax and type
errors. The main goal of this project is to re-implement the back-end of
the application, which currently uses UIKit to render graphics, to use
Metal [@metal], an Apple framework that provides access to Apple GPUs.

# Team

The team members will consist of the following:

-   Lucas Matthew Dutton - 4th year Software Engineer

-   Michael Le - 4th year Software Engineer

-   Saad Khan - 4th year Software Engineer and Embedded Systems

-   Thomas Bernard Armena - 4th year Software Engineer

-   Wyatt Wismer - 4th year Software Engineer

# Hard Goals

A list of hard goals that this project will aim to complete are:

-   Understand all technologies involved in the project, including the
    Elm and Swift languages, and the Metal GPU language.

-   Reimplement the rendering backend to use Metal.

-   Add support for the interpreter front-end to support recursion in
    functions.

# Stretch Goals

A list of stretch goals that this project may complete are:

-   Add support for 3D graphics, using Elm 3D as the front-end language.
    This goal is dependent on an external team working on the completion
    of Elm 3D.

-   Supporting user interaction with the generated graphics.

-   Benchmarking and optimizing the process of rendering graphics.
